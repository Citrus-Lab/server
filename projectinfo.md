We’re building an AI platform where users can access multiple models on a single page (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, etc.) and choose whichever one fits best for the task. The UI will provide two modes: manual (user selects the model) and auto (the system analyzes the input question and routes it to the model most suited for that domain). Auto Mode Integration → system uses leaderboard to pick the best AI per task // lmarena leaderboard ya web se pata kr lenga.
